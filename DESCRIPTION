Description: Functions for constructing Transformed and Relative Lorenz curves with survey sampling weights. Given a variable of interest measured in two groups with scaled survey weights so that their hypothetical populations are of equal size, tlorenz() computes the proportion of members of the group with smaller values (ordered from smallest to largest) needed for their sum to match the sum of the top qth percentile of the group with higher values. rlorenz() shows the fraction of the total value of the group with larger values held by the pth percentile of those in the group with smaller values. Fd() is a survey weighted cumulative distribution function and Eps() is a survey weighted inverse cdf used in rlorenz(). Ramos, Graubard, and Gastwirth (2025) <doi:10.1093/jrsssa/qnaf044>.
